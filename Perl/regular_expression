re 'debug' pragma
        use re 'debug';  
    The use re 'debug' pragma comes with Perl 5.005 and later. You can watch Perl's regular expression engine at work
    to verify for yourself if Perl is recompiling a regular expression.
  
  
/O option
    The /o option for regular expression tells Perl to complie the regular expression only once.
    This is only usefule when the pattern contains a variable. Perl 5.6 and later handle this automatically if
    the patter does not change. So, you don't need the /o option. It doesn't hurt, but it doesn't help either.

    Regexp::Common::comment -- provide regexes for comments.
    
    
How can I quote a variable to use in a regex?
    The Perl parser will expand $variable and @variable references in regular expressions unless the delimiter is a single quote. 
    The [right-hand side] of a s/// substitution is considered a double-quoted string.
    Remember that ANY regex special characters will be acted on unless you precede the substitution with \Q. 
    
        $string = "Placido P. Octopus";
        $regex  = "P.";

        $string =~ s/$regex/Polyp/;
        # $string is now "Polypacido P. Octopus"
        
        $string =~ s/\Q$regex/Polyp/;
        # $string is now "Placido Polyp Octopus"

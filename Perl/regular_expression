re 'debug' pragma
        use re 'debug';  
    The use re 'debug' pragma comes with Perl 5.005 and later. You can watch Perl's regular expression engine at work
    to verify for yourself if Perl is recompiling a regular expression.
  
  
/O option
    The /o option for regular expression tells Perl to complie the regular expression only once.
    This is only usefule when the pattern contains a variable. Perl 5.6 and later handle this automatically if
    the patter does not change. So, you don't need the /o option. It doesn't hurt, but it doesn't help either.

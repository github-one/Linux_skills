Methods for comparing
    - File::Compare
    - Digest::MD5           # If you only need to know whether they are the same (i.e. not discover how they are different)
    - Algorithem::Diff      # If you want to find out which lines are different.
    - Text::Diff            # It's bulit on top of Algorithem::Diff
    - File::DirCompare      # Perl module to compare two directories using callbacks.
    - Perl::Metrics::Simple     # Count packages, subs, lines, cyclomatic (mccabe) complexity, etc. of many files.
    

File::Compare
    use File::Compare;
    if (compare ("file1", "file2") == 0) { 
        print "They're equal\n";
    }
    
    Note: File::Compare already checks for file size.

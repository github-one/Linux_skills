    A list is a fixed collection of scalars. 
    An array is a variable that holds a variable collection of scalars. 
    
    An array can supply its collection for list operations, so list operations also work on arrays:
        - slice:            (3,4,5,6,7,8)[2,3];   @array[2];  @array[2,3];
        - iterator:         foreach ( ) { }
        - supply an argument list (such as for a subroutine)

    Array operations, which change the list, only work on arrays.
        - shift, unshift, push, pop, and splice
        - $#animals = 1;        # truncate to two elements
          $#animals = 10000;    # pre-extend to 10,001 elements
        - $animals[0] = 'Rottweiler';
          qw( dog cat bird )[0] = 'Rottweiler'; # syntax error!

            foreach ( @animals ) {
                s/^d/fr/;  # works fine
            }
            foreach ( qw( dog cat bird ) ) {
                s/^d/fr/;  # Error! Modification of read only value!
            }
         - my $count = @animals;                    # only works with arrays   
           my $scalar = ( 'dog', 'cat', 'bird' );   # $scalar gets bird

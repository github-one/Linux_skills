     note:
     Scalar values are always named with '$', even when referring to a scalar that is part of an array or a hash.
     The '$' symbol works semantically like the English word "the" in that it indicates a single value is expected.
     To create a hash reference you could start with a hash, or with an anonymous hash reference:
            soem_sub(\%hash);
            som_sub( {pi => 3.14, C => 4});

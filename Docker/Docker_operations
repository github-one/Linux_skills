Q:  How to start a stopped Docker container with a different command?
    I would like to start a stopped Docker container with a different command, as the default command crashes - meaning 
    I can't start the container and then use 'docker exec'. 
    Basically I would like to start a shell so I can inspect the contents of the container.
    Luckily I created the container with the -it option!
    
A:  Find your stopped container id
    $ docker ps -a
    Commit the stopped container:
    This command saves modified container state into a new image user/test_image

    $ docker commit $CONTAINER_ID user/test_image
    Start/run with a different entry point:
    $ docker run -ti --entrypoint=sh user/test_image
    
    Note:
    Steps above just start a stopped container with the same filesystem state. That is great for a quick investigation. 
    But environment variables, network configuration, attached volumes and other staff is not inherited, you should 
    specify all these arguments explicitly.

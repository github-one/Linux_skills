Q:  How to add a GPG key to the apt sources keyring?
A:  It is advisable that you add the Opera GPG key.
    $ wget -qO - http://deb.opera.com/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -
    
    Now to verify that it worked, run this command (from this answer):
    $ apt-key list
    This will list the keys added and the key from Opera should be listed on the bottom like this:
    pub   1024D/30C18A2B 2012-10-29 [expires: 2014-10-29]
    uid                  Opera Software Archive Automatic Signing Key 2013 <packager@opera.com>
    sub   4096g/C528FCA9 2012-10-29 [expires: 2014-10-29]
    
    You can remove the key if needed, using:
    sudo apt-key del 30C18A2B
    with 30C18A2B being the key-id from the list.

    After performing that command, and setting up the sources exactly like in your screen-shot, do:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install opera




== Question ==
what is the function of /etc/apt/sources.list.d?
I added LLVM Debian/Ubuntu nightly packages in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory as llvm.list. Then I ran apt-get
update, but got the following error

GPG Error: The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project llvm-toolchain-trusty InRelease: no public keyï¼Œcan not qulify the
signature: NO_PUBKEY 15CF4D18AF4F7421 I thought if I added the source as a file in the directory, it will be seen as a
package source. What else do I need to do?


== Answer ==
The function of the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory is as follows:

Using the directory you can easily add new repositories without the need to edit the central /etc/apt/sources.list file.
I.e. you can just put a file with a unique name and the same format as /etc/apt/sources.list into this folder and it is
used by apt.

In order to remove this source again you can just remove that specific file without the need for handling side effects,
parsing or mangling with /etc/apt/sources.list. It's mainly for scripts or other packages to put their repositories
there automatically - if you manually add repositories you could add them to /etc/apt/sources.list manually.

This answers your question, however, it won't solve your problem. APT is complaining about a missing GPG key which you
have to manually import before you can use your newly added repository (GPG verifies all data cryptographically and
needs the public keys of the owners for this).

This can be done calling sudo apt-key add public-key-file or wget -qO - http://example.com/archive.key | sudo apt-key
add - where http://example.com/archive.keyis the URL for the public key (which you should verify before using).

In case of llvm, you could issue wget -O - http://llvm.org/apt/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key|sudo apt-key add - (according to
http://llvm.org/apt/)

NTP:  The Network Time Protocol
NTP is a protocol for synchronizing the clocks of computer systems over packet-switched, variable-altency date networks.
NTP uses UDP port 123 as its transport layer. It is designed particularly to resist the effects of vairable latency( Jitter ).

RTC: Real Time Clock, It is the hardware time supported by the circuit of computer main board.
System Clock: It is the kernel time supported by Operation System, just synced once with RTC when starting up.


------------------------------------------ Sync Date Betwwen Machines ---------------------------------------------------------
/etc/ntp.conf:      Server configuration file.
/usr/sbin/ntpd:     NTP Server command.
/usr/sbin/npdate:   Force the local host to sync date with server.


Step 1: Install NTP tool
        $ yum install ntp

Step 2: For time server host
        $ ntpd start
        
Step 3: For time client host, edit file /etc/ntp.conf, add the following line and delete/comment other servers
        server [ time server ipaddress ] [prefer]
        
Step 4: Restart clinet ntp server
        $ ntp restart
        
Step 5: Check log and server port
        $ tail /var/log/messages
        $ netstat -tlunp | grep ntp
        
Step 6: Check the handshakes betweeen server and client ( it may take 10 minutes to build the handshake )
        $ ntpstat
        or
        $ ntpq -p
        There is a '*' before the remote server ip when the hankshake is built.


--------------------------------------- NTP Server Without External Clock Reference --------------------------------------------
Edit /etc/ntp.conf  (note: 127.127.1.0 is the local ntpd server address, not 127.0.0.1 !!!)

server 127.127.1.0
fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 8

Note:
1. 127.127.1.0 is the local ntpd server address.
2. If a client receives server ntp packets with stratum greater than 16, it will complains and fails syncing.


Q: There is a private and secure network as so I'm trying to implement simply a peer to peer time syncing setup.
   As I have no external clock to sync against I am trying to set one of the boxes as the reference clock but I always 
   get the same error:
   10.10.64.11 is inappropriate address for the fudge command, line ignored
   
   My ntp.conf file looks like this
        server  10.10.64.11 # increase stratum
        peer 10.10.64.10
        fudge  10.10.64.11 stratum 10
        driftfile /etc/ntp.drift
        logfile /etc/ntp.log
   
A:  Reference clocks have addresses 127.127.x.y. The x encodes the type of clock, the y is simply a clock identifier.

        server 127.127.1.0
        fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 10

    Reference clock type 1 is a computer's internal clock. It should be sed only if an NTP server should (continue to) 
    erve time when it (temporarily or permanently) has no real reference clock available, and should always be fudged to 
    high stratum.


------------------------------------------- Sync Date Without Sever -----------------------------------------------------------

Q:  How can I sync Date time in two computers without NTP server?
A:  Try the following command:
        $ remote_time=`ssh user@machine1 date` $$ date -s $remote_time
        ( or $ date --set="$(ssh user@machine1 date)" 
          or $ ssh user@machine2 "date --set\"$(date)\"" 
        )
    CAVEAT: The two commands will take some time to complete, such as 0.x seconds, depending the situation.
    If you need millisecond accuracy, this will not work. The only thing that will work is syscing both machines 
    to an NTP server.
  
------------------------------------------- Others -----------------------------------------------------------
ntpdate -buv 1.us.pool.ntp.org
-b is for when your machine is out of sync for more than 1000s
-u makes ntpdate use unprivileged ports
-v is for verbosity.
-d Enable the debugging mode, in which ntpdate will go through all the steps, but not adjust the local clock.

NTP:  The Network Time Protocol
NTP is a protocol for synchronizing the clocks of computer systems over packet-switched, variable-altency date networks.
NTP uses UDP port 123 as its transport layer. It is designed particularly to resist the effects of vairable latency( Jitter ).

RTC: Real Time Clock, It is the hardware time supported by the circuit of computer main board.
System Clock: It is the kernel time supported by Operation System, just synced once with RTC when starting up.


------------------------------------------ Sync Date Betwwen Machines ---------------------------------------------------------
/etc/ntp.conf:      Server configuration file.
/usr/sbin/ntpd:     NTP Server command.
/usr/sbin/npdate:   Force the local host to sync date with server.


Step 1: Install NTP tool
        $ yum install ntp

Step 2: For time server host
        $ ntpd start
        
Step 3: For time client host, edit file /etc/ntp.conf, add the following line and delete/comment other servers
        server [ time server ipaddress ] [prefer]
        
Step 4: Restart clinet ntp server
        $ ntp restart
        
Step 5: Check log and server port
        $ tail /var/log/messages
        $ netstat -tlunp | grep ntp
        
Step 6: Check the handshakes betweeen server and client ( it may take 10 minutes to build the handshake )
        $ ntpstat
        or
        $ ntpq -p
        There is a '*' before the remote server ip when the hankshake is built.

------------------------------------------- Sync Date Without Sever -----------------------------------------------------------

Q:  How can I sync Date time in two computers without NTP server?
A:  Try the following command:
        $ remote_time=`ssh user@machine1 date` $$ date -s $remote_time
        ( or $ date --set="$(ssh user@machine1 date)" 
          or $ ssh user@machine2 "date --set\"$(date)\"" 
        )
    CAVEAT: The two commands will take some time to complete, such as 0.x seconds, depending the situation.
    If you need millisecond accuracy, this will not work. The only thing that will work is syscing both machines 
    to an NTP server.
  
------------------------------------------- Others -----------------------------------------------------------
ntpdate -buv 1.us.pool.ntp.org
-b is for when your machine is out of sync for more than 1000s
-u makes ntpdate use unprivileged ports
-v is for verbosity.

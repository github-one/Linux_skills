Q: How to install a plugin in Jenkins manually?
A: There are two ways to install jenkins plugins.

Way 1#: (installing from Jenkins front-end)
1 Download the plugin.
2 Inside Jenkins: Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugin -> There is a tab called "Advanced" and on that page
there is an option to upload a plugin (the extension of the file must be hpi).
Sometimes, when you download plugins file with '*.zip', then you may rename it with '*.hpi'.

Way 2#: (manually putinng the .hpi file in Jenkins home directory)
Download the plugin (*.hpi file) and put it in the following directory: <jenkinsHome>/plugins/
( <jenkinsHome> may be /var/lib/jenkins mostly)
Afterwards you will need to restart Jenkins.

There are many plugins files ending with .jpi instead of .hpi, because Jenkins renames the plugin files
during the installation from .hpi to .jpi so it's able to detect a new plugin to install over an existing one.

When you install the plugin manually (downloaded as .hpi file) it is installed with extension .hpi 
and while installing the plugin through Jenkins front-end the plugin file will be changed as .jpi.

when Jenkins boots up, the plugin "*.jpi" gets precedence over plugin "*.hpi" in case both are present.

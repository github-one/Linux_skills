------------------------------------------- Execute privilege -----------------------------------------
Assuming that jenkins is running in Ubuntu.

1. Operation is running by the username of 'jenkins'.
2. The working diectory is /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/xxx, the xxx is the name of pipeline created.
3. The usernmae of 'jenkins' has no right on '/root/xxx'
4. If needed, put 'jenkins' int 'root' group and do not forget to restart the jenkins.


------------------------------------------- Pipeline Execution  -----------------------------------------
1. If the last task return value is 0, the pipleline will report success. Otherwise it will report failure.

2. The default shell is sh for the build's "Exectue shell", but this is configurable.
3. The script will be run with the workspace as the current directory. 
4. If your shell script has no header line like #!/bin/sh â€”, then the shell configured system-wide will be used, 
5. The header line can like "#!/bin/perl"
6. By default, the shell will be invoked with the "-ex" option. 
So all of the commands are printed before being executed, and the build is considered a failure if any of the commands 
exits with a non-zero exit code. Again, add the #!/bin/... line to change this behavior.
7. As a best practice, try not to put a long shell script in here, but use "bash -ex myscript.sh" or something like that.


------------------------------------------- Pipeline Questions  -----------------------------------------
Q: Waht is the default Jenkins passowrd?
A1:
   $ sudo passwd jenkins
   
A2:
Stop Jenkins
Go go edit /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml
Change <useSecurity>true</useSecurity> to false
Restart Jenkins: sudo service jenkins restart
Navigate to the Jenkins dashboard to the "Configure Security" option you likely used before. 
This time, setup security the same as before, BUT set it to allow anyone to do anything, and allow user signup.
Go to www.yoursite.com/securityRealm/addUser and create a user
Then go change allow anyone to do anything to whatever you actually want users to be able to do. 
In my case, it is allow logged in users to do anything.

Q: How to restart Jenkins manually?
A1: (By the website) 
   (jenkins_url)/safeRestart      
   - Allows all running jobs to complete. New jobs will remain in the queue to run after the restart is complete.
  
   (jenkins_url)/restart - Forces a restart without waiting for builds to complete.
   Example: 100.100.245.9:8080/restart
   
A2: (By the shell)   
$ sudo service jenkins status
$ sudo service jenkins start
$ sudo service jenkins stop
$ sudo service jenkins restart
or
$ sudo /etc/init.d/jenkins restart
Usage: /etc/init.d/jenkins {start|stop|status|restart|force-reload}

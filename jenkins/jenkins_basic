Q: Waht is the default Jenkins passowrd?
A1:
   $ sudo passwd jenkins
   
A2:
Stop Jenkins
Go go edit /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml
Change <useSecurity>true</useSecurity> to false
Restart Jenkins: sudo service jenkins restart
Navigate to the Jenkins dashboard to the "Configure Security" option you likely used before. 
This time, setup security the same as before, BUT set it to allow anyone to do anything, and allow user signup.
Go to www.yoursite.com/securityRealm/addUser and create a user
Then go change allow anyone to do anything to whatever you actually want users to be able to do. 
In my case, it is allow logged in users to do anything.

Q: How to restart Jenkins manually?
A1: (By the website) 
   (jenkins_url)/safeRestart      
   - Allows all running jobs to complete. New jobs will remain in the queue to run after the restart is complete.
  
   (jenkins_url)/restart - Forces a restart without waiting for builds to complete.
   Example: 100.100.245.9:8080/restart
   
A2: (By the shell)   
$ sudo service jenkins status
$ sudo service jenkins start
$ sudo service jenkins stop
$ sudo service jenkins restart
or
$ sudo /etc/init.d/jenkins restart
Usage: /etc/init.d/jenkins {start|stop|status|restart|force-reload}

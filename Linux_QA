Q:  Why is the size of “/proc/kcore” file so bigger than the physical memory size?
A:  kcore is the virtual allocation of your RAM for the kernel. 
    On 64 bit systems that size can be an absolute limit of 128T since that is the most the system can allocate.
    A range of pseudo and virtual filesystems exists which exposes information about processes and other system information 
    in a hierarchical file-like structure. These are mounted into the single file hierarchy.
    An example of this purely virtual filesystem is under /proc that exposes many system properties as files.

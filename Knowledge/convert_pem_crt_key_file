-----Converting Using OpenSSL----
Convert a DER file (.crt .cer .der) to PEM
openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem

Convert a PEM file to DER
openssl x509 -outform der -in certificate.pem -out certificate.der

Convert a PKCS#12 file (.pfx .p12) containing a private key and certificates to PEM
openssl pkcs12 -in keyStore.pfx -out keyStore.pem -nodes

You can add -nocerts to only output the private key or add -nokeys to only output the certificates.
Convert a PEM certificate file and a private key to PKCS#12 (.pfx .p12)
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.crt -certfile CACert.crt

Convert PEM to CRT (.CRT file)
openssl x509 -outform der -in certificate.pem -out certificate.crt

---OpenSSL Convert PEM----
Convert PEM to DER
openssl x509 -outform der -in certificate.pem -out certificate.der

Convert PEM to P7B
openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile certificate.cer -out certificate.p7b -certfile CACert.cer

Convert PEM to PFX
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.crt -certfile CACert.crt

-----OpenSSL Convert DER----
Convert DER to PEM
openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem

------------------------------------------------ X.509 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
In cryptography, X.509 is a standard defining the format of publice key certificates. 
X.509 certificates are used in many Internet protocols, including TLS/SSL.
An X.509 certificate contains a public key and and identity(a hostname, or an organization, or an individual), and is either
signed yb a certificate authority or self-signed.

In the X.509 system, an organization that wants a signed certificate requests one via a certificate signing request (CSR).

To do this, it first generates a key pair, keeping the private key secret and using it to sign the CSR. 
This contains information identifying the applicant and the applicant's public key that is used to verify the signature 
of the CSR - and the Distinguished Name (DN) that the certificate is for. 
The CSR may be accompanied by other credentials or proofs of identity required by the certificate authority.

The certification authority issues a certificate binding a public key to a particular distinguished name.

An organization's trusted root certificates can be distributed to all employees so that they can use the company PKI system.

Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Safari and Chrome come with a predetermined set of root certificates 
pre-installed, so SSL certificates from major certificate authorities will work instantly.

X.509 and RFC 5280 also include standards for certificate revocation list (CRL) implementations.


----------------------------------------------- Certificate filename extensions -----------------------------------------------------
There are several commonly used filename extensions for X.509 certificates. 
Unfortunately, some of these extensions are also used for other data such as private keys.

.pem – (Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail) Base64 encoded DER certificate, 
       enclosed between "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
.cer, .crt, .der – usually in binary DER form, but Base64-encoded certificates are common too (see .pem above)
.p7b, .p7c – PKCS#7 SignedData structure without data, just certificate(s) or CRL(s)
.p12 – PKCS#12, may contain certificate(s) (public) and private keys (password protected)
.pfx – PFX, predecessor of PKCS#12 (usually contains data in PKCS#12 format, e.g., with PFX files generated in IIS)

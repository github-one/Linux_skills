Q:  See the size of a github repo before cloning it?
A:  
If you own the respo, then:  your Account Settings > Repositories
If you don't won the respo, then you may access this information through the GitHub API.
For example:  https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins
open a web browser, input: https://api.github.com/repos/jenkinsci/jenkins, then search for "size", you will get 
 "size": 112047,
 so the size of "jenkins" is 112047K. 
 
There's a way to access this information through the GitHub API.
syntax: /repos/:user/:repo [GET]
example: https://api.github.com/repos/git/git
When retrieving information about a repository, a property named size is valued with the size of the whole repository
(including all of its history), in kilobytes.
For instance, the Git repository weights around 40Mb. The size property of the returned JSON payload is valued to 40764.

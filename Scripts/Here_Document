A here document is used to redirect input into an interactive shell script or program.

We can run an interactive program within a shell script without user action by supplying the required input 
for the interactive program, or interactive shell script.

The general form for a here document is −

command << delimiter
document
delimiter

Here the shell interprets the << operator as an instruction to read input until it finds a line containing the specified delimiter. 
All the input lines up to the line containing the delimiter are then fed into the standard input of the command.
The delimiter tells the shell that the here document has completed. 
Without it, the shell continues to read the input forever. 
Note:
1. The delimiter must be A SINGLE WORD that does not contain SPACEs or TABs.
2. The second delimiter must at the start of the line, withou any blanks before or after.


Examples:

Following is the input to the command wc -l to count the total number of lines −

    $wc -l << EOF
       This is a simple lookup program 
      for good (and bad) restaurants
      in Cape Town.
    EOF
    3
    $
    
You can use the here document to print multiple lines using your script as follows −
    #!/bin/sh

    cat << EOF
    This is a simple lookup program 
    for good (and bad) restaurants
    in Cape Town.
    EOF	

Upon execution, you will receive the following result −
    This is a simple lookup program
    for good (and bad) restaurants
    in Cape Town.    
    
    
The following script runs a session with the vi text editor and saves the input in the file test.txt.

    #!/bin/sh

    filename=test.txt
    vi $filename <<EndOfCommands
    i
    This file was created automatically from
    a shell script
    ^[
    ZZ
    EndOfCommands

If you run this script with vim acting as vi, then you will likely see output like the following −
    $ sh test.sh
    Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal
    $
    
After running the script, you should see the following added to the file test.txt −
    $ cat test.txt
    This file was created automatically from
    a shell script
    $

$ printf '=%.0s' {1..100}

The format to "=%.0s" which means that it will always print a single = no matter what argument it is given. 
Therefore it prints 100 =s.

$ printf -v foo "%s" "something string"

Pass the -v var option to the printf command to assign the output to shell variable VAR rather than display it 
on the standard output/screen.

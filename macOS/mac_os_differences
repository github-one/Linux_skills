### systemctl vs launchctl  ###
The equivalent to Linux systemctl on macOS would be launchctl. 
Apache also has it's own HTTP Server Control Interface, apachectl.

Systemd, which systemctl is a part of, is a service manager designed specifically for Linux 
and uses interfaces and constructs specific to it such as cgroups. 
There is no port of it to Mac OS.

Start a service in mac:
$ load System Libary

Check services in mac:
$ sudo launchctl list | grep sshd


### List open network ports ###
$ netstat -ap tcp | grep -i "listen"
Achive Internet connections (including servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)   
tcp4       0      0  localhost.25035        *.*                    LISTEN

-a: all ports
-p: port type, such as: TCP, tcp, UDP, udp
-n: show network address as number
-v: increase verbosity level


### List open files ###
$ sudo lsof -PiTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
COMMAND     PID      USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
GitHub      850 grgarside   6u   IPv4 0x23c345381d089301      0t0  TCP localhost:25035 (LISTEN)

$ sudo lsof -nP +c 15   | grep LISTEN
$ sudo lsof -Pn -i4     | grep -i "listen"
$ sudo lsof -Pn -iTCP   | grep -i "listen"
$ lsof -nP -i4TCP:$PORT | grep LISTEN           # for example: $PORT is 80
$ lsof -nP -i:$PORT     | grep LISTEN

“lsof” is a contraction for “list open files”. 
Without any options specifications, lsof lists all open files belonging to all active processes.

"-i4" means only show ipv4 address and ports -P and -n fast output
“-nP” is a combination of "-n" and "-P".
“-n” for no resolution of IPs to hostnames using DNS 
“-P” for no resolution of Port names from numbers.
This is because the command already takes several seconds to run.

"-PiTCP -sTCP:LISTEN" means that listing only network files with TCP state LISTEN.

“+c 15” specifies command width of 15 and the command example is "GitHub".


On macOS High Sierra, use this command:  
$ lsof -nP -i4TCP:$PORT | grep LISTEN
On older versions, use one of the following forms:
$ lsof -nP -iTCP:$PORT  | grep LISTEN
$ lsof -nP -i:$PORT     | grep LISTEN
Since Snow Leopard (10.6), up to Mojave (10.14), every version of macOS supports this:
$ sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P

Substitute $PORT with the port number or a comma-separated list of port numbers.

Prepend sudo (followed by a space) if you need information on ports below #1024.

PROTIP: If you’ll be using this often, create an alias such as of.

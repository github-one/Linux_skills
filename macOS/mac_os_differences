### systemctl vs launchctl  ###
The equivalent to Linux systemctl on macOS would be launchctl. 
Apache also has it's own HTTP Server Control Interface, apachectl.

Systemd, which systemctl is a part of, is a service manager designed specifically for Linux 
and uses interfaces and constructs specific to it such as cgroups. 
There is no port of it to Mac OS.

Start a service in mac:
$ load System Libary

Check services in mac:
$ sudo launchctl list | grep sshd


### List open network ports ###
$ netstat -ap tcp | grep -i "listen"
Achive Internet connections (including servers)

$lsof -nP +c 15 | grep LISTEN

PROTIP: If you’ll be using this often, create an alias such as of.

“lsof” is a contraction for “list open files”. Without any options specifications, 
lsof lists all open files belonging to all active processes.

“-nP” is a combination of “n” for no resolution of IPs to hostnames using DNS 
and “P” for no resolution of Port names from numbers.
This is because the command already takes several seconds to run.

“+c 15” specifies command width of 15.

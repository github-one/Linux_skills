## systemctl vs launchctl
The equivalent to Linux systemctl on macOS would be launchctl. 
Apache also has it's own HTTP Server Control Interface, apachectl.

Systemd, which systemctl is a part of, is a service manager designed specifically for Linux 
and uses interfaces and constructs specific to it such as cgroups. 
There is no port of it to Mac OS.

Start a service in mac:
$ load System Libary

Check services in mac:
$ sudo launchctl list | grep sshd
